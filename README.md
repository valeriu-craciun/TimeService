# TimeService
This is a Spring Boot Rest Services which is offering a single web method of getTime
* stupid and simple enough to understand Spring Boot and Java
* deployed to OpenShift Online - check it on for http://my-time-service-theservices.7e14.starter-us-west-2.openshiftapps.com/getTime
* for those interested in Java it does not offer locale( meaning based on country code shows you the details of hours, minutes etc. ), it is just a demonstration of how to return in JSON format of the time and date.
